# Frontend Mentor - Designo Agency Website Challenge

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️: If you choose to do the bonus part of the challenge and use a mapping API, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). It's free to use and doesn't require an API Key. If you decide to use another API, like Google Maps or Mapbox, be sure to secure your API Key. Here are guides for both Google Maps and Mapbox, be sure to read through them thoroughly:

- [API Key best practices from Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-key-best-practices)
- [How to use Mapbox securely](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/how-to-use-mapbox-securely/)

Exposing your API Key publicly can lead to other people using it to make requests for their own application if the proper precautions aren't in place. Please be sure you read the guides thoroughly and follow their recommendations.
